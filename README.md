<h>Hi, I'm Dong Woo </h>

- I'm currently a student at UW-Madison pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Biochemistry, which I started attending in 2022.
- I work under the [Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation](https://loci.wisc.edu/), specifically on [CurveAlign V6.0](https://github.com/uw-loci/curvelets)
